      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I had a format for sharing thoughts in long form; not since LiveJournal days.
I miss it. I miss the luxury of words that haven&amp;rsquo;t been trimmed to unnatural shortness for the sole purpose of maximizing likability. I&amp;rsquo;m tired of working for free, sharing my integrity and authenticity for an abusive corporation&amp;rsquo;s profit.
Watching a friend resume his own practice has inspired me to resume a long-form discipline of my own.</description>
